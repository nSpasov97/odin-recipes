    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake is so easy to make and, unlike some versions, 
        is surprisingly light. Even though we’re using lots of apples, 
        the texture is not dense and heavy, which is sometimes the case 
        with this type of cake.
         Here are some tips to get you started</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The secret is: There is no secret. Just measure carefully, 
                take your time mixing in the eggs, and don’t over bake it. 
                When a toothpick or skewer comes out clean, your cake is done,
                 and you can move on to the real challenge with this recipe, 
                which is what to serve with it. </li>
            <li>I went with a simple rum-scented whipped cream, but vanilla ice cream, 
                fresh berries, custard, or a salted caramel sauce 
                would all be spectacular. </li>
         </ul>

    <p>But, whether you use one of those classic pairings or simply eat a slice 
        as-is, this is a perfect fall dessert,
         and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 large baking apples (such as Honeycrisp)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/EJA7qQtDzV_-2OMwMEReomy8IKQ=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-01-d2f9d6e2f94e47d195939fea3dd9dfca.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Peel (or leave skin on) and core apples; cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, they won’t get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/2iTDlUELVuTFZxkH8rKPxkoIaPc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-02-136ff29edb5e48d0b8e0c3c499711e36.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/T4x57UbBrJE8va-k7nCmeooF3Rc=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-03-1abddfc39b8b4ba5b81c6d75715ccee8.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add the second egg and repeat.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/6vZJ0cAVmAkZXvORhUOIrqLxCxE=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-04-8d34b67a27cb429b98cbba729777eab0.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture.  When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/oc-HyDaSjkcd7jv2YYJkgxzev8s=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-05-7a3e9054151e4b02a9d51bde6c9b7f9a.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Fold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly. Smooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/T7dqO12SqkP3n9Oy5-oVueB2tdI=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-06-3f7178e77bba477494b92420095fc6b8.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/Iay_wwayHrAxUQncsXkh8j4z34o=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-step-07-c3d599e3ebd843fc9a9602aafec3febe.jpg" width="250"></li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack, place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/MTYBFCzvobgoM_RlKZT8t078rJA=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/7963451-french-apple-cake-recipe-VAT-Beauty-4x3-e35c5684615144e6aa8a22267f5b4219.jpg" width="250"></li>
